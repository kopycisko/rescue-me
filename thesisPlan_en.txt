1. Abstract

(for now short and informal)
There is strictly defined environment - underground corridor. The corridor is free from external radio waves. As a person working in the corridor I want to determine my current position with a mobile device (Smartphone).

* There is need to find and install navigation system that will allow to determine current position of mobile device in the corridor.
* There is need to verify location accuracy of basic algorithm that use the navigation system infrastructure only and explore the possibilities to improve location accuracy using sensors built into the mobile device.

3. Introduction

3.1 Underground installation characteristics
Description of:
* Construction (very briefly):
** how can look like: from complicated (room and phillar) to simple (tunneling)
** distances
* Conditions in therms of light and air.
* What wireless communication methods are available?

Answer questions:
* if we need the navigation in whole installation? if yes, why?
* if we need the navigation only in some places inside installation? if yes, why?
* what factors may require from navigation system its extensive lifetime?


3.2 Usage of mobile devices in underground installations
* Define 'mobile device'

Answer questions:
* If mobile device (smartphone class) can be used in undergorund installations?
* How usage of mobile device in underground installations may differ from usage in normal conditions (outside underground installation)?


3.3 Navigation system use-cases
* Introduce 2-3 ideas with visualizations
